WeathAware – AI-Driven Pre-Flight Weather Intelligence Platform
Overview

WeathAware is an interactive aviation safety platform designed to simplify and enhance pre-flight planning for pilots. Built during the HackSpace Hackathon (25–27 Sept) organized by SDG CLUB–MIT BLR & MITB ACM Student Chapter, and powered by Honeywell Technologies, the project ranked Top 25 out of 250+ teams.

Under the theme Design of Weather Services Summary, our team focused on solving one of the most critical challenges in aviation: making pre-flight weather briefings accurate, fast, and pilot-friendly.

Problem Statement

Pilots face significant cognitive load during pre-flight planning due to the large volume and complexity of METARs, TAFs, NOTAMs, PIREPs, weather charts, and hazard warnings. Traditional tools are either fragmented or lack AI capabilities to decode, summarize, and provide real-time hazard intelligence.

Even small oversights in these coded reports can escalate into serious operational risks.

WeathAware addresses this gap through an integrated, AI-powered platform that automates decoding, hazard detection, mapping, and reporting—giving pilots clear, actionable insights at a glance.
