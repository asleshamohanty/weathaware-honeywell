# WeathAware – AI-Driven Pre-Flight Weather Intelligence Platform
Honeywell x MITB Hackathon - Top 25 out of 250+ teams
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7385927362233757696/

## 1. Overview

WeathAware is an interactive aviation safety platform designed to simplify and enhance pre-flight planning for pilots.
Built during the HackSpace Hackathon (25–27 Sept) organized by SDG CLUB–MIT BLR & MITB ACM Student Chapter and powered by Honeywell Technologies, the project ranked Top 25 out of 250+ teams.

Under the theme "Design of Weather Services Summary", our team focused on solving one of the most critical challenges in aviation:
making pre-flight weather briefings accurate, fast, intelligent, and pilot-friendly.

## 2. Problem Statement

Pilots face significant cognitive load during pre-flight planning due to the extensive volume and complexity of:

METARs

TAFs

NOTAMs

PIREPs

Weather charts

Airspace restrictions

Hazard warnings

Traditional systems often lack AI-driven decoding or real-time risk detection. Even small oversights in these coded reports can escalate into operational risks.

WeathAware solves this by automating decoding, hazard detection, mapping, and briefing generation — delivering clear, actionable insights at a glance.
